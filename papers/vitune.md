    <p class="research-figure-caption">In this pilot Wizard-of-Oz study, we explored the use of two-party conversations that is played in the middle of driving a recommended route (leftmost image). The conversations involve two voice agents with two turns each. In this example, the Optimal voice agent continues to suggest a faster route while the Familiar voice agent presents an alternative that uses previously taken routes. The participants in the pilot experiment were recommended three routes: route F (familiar), route O (optimal) and route E (explorer). They drove in simulation environment with the researcher manually playing the voice navigation guidance.</p>
