    <p class="research-figure-caption">In our model, we introduced the Exposed compartments to both truth and rumor. We developed two mathematical models based on the SEIR model that describes spreader-spreader and exposed-spreader interactions. From a macro-level, we observed the general effects of changing the rates of spreading truth on the population as a whole. </p>
