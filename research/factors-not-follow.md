    <p class="research-figure-caption">A sample trip from our data collection with instances of the driver deviating from the recommended route shown by the application. Here, the first deviation was made at the beginning of the trip where the driver opted to choose a route that will get him directly to the main road, and not the recommendation which is circuity and perceived as unnecessary. The second deviation was made at a fork on the expressway. Instead of following the recommended route that will take him farther from the destination, he chose his regular route despite the application indicating that there is heavy traffic.</p>
