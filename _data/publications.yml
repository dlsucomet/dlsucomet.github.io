      abstract: "Community-level bans are a common tool against groups that enable online harassment and harmful speech. Unfortunately, the efficacy of community bans has only been partially studied and with mixed results. Here, we provide a flexible unsupervised methodology to identify in-group language and track user activity on Reddit both before and after the ban of a community (subreddit). We use a simple word frequency divergence to identify uncommon words overrepresented in a given community, not as a proxy for harmful speech but as a linguistic signature of the community. We apply our method to 15 banned subreddits, and find that community response is heterogeneous between subreddits and between users of a subreddit. Top users were more likely to become less active overall, while random users often reduced use of in-group language without decreasing activity. Finally, we find some evidence that the effectiveness of bans aligns with the content of a community. Users of dark humor communities were largely unaffected by bans while users of communities organized around white supremacy and fascism were the most affected. Altogether, our results show that bans do not affect all groups or users equally, and pave the way to understanding the effect of bans across communities."

      abstract: "Manual schedule creation often involves satisfying numerous unique and conflicting constraints, which becomes more cognitively demanding when creating a common academic schedule with other individuals. Poor decision making caused by cognitive overload can result in unsuitable schedules. This study proposes the use of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers in an academic scheduling system to help students balance scheduling preferences and satisfy necessary constraints. Based on the availability of courses and the scheduling preferences of users, the system automatically resolves conflicts and presents possible schedules. In a controlled experiment with 42 undergraduate students, cognitive demand was reduced by eliminating menial decisions, which significantly optimized the creation of a common schedule among peers. We found that human errors and emotional stress were diminished, and schedules created using the system were more satisfactory to participants. Finally, we present recommendations and design implications for future academic scheduling systems."

      abstract: "Deep learning is an emerging field that attracts attention from various researchers to use in analyzing and understanding increasingly complex systems and phenomena. Crucial to the advancement of deep learning research in the Philippines, institutions need to understand its direction and reach out and work with other leading researchers who have knowledge, insight, and resources to contribute to the challenges in deep learning research. Due to its wide application, we analyzed the collaboration dynamics and patterns of Filipino researchers working in this field through their co-authorship network. Our study found that while there is a steady increase in research productivity on deep learning, most of the publications and collaborations are concentrated on a handful of institutions like De La Salle University and University of the Philippines Diliman. Despite their current control over the direction of the local research community, these two top institutions have yet to form strong collaborations. We also found that Filipino researchers are mostly doing applied deep learning projects and rely heavily on undergraduate students to maintain productivity."

      abstract: "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N6) is a mutated virus of Influenza A (H5N1) and a new emerging infection that recently caused an outbreak in the Philippines. The 2017 H5N6 outbreak resulted in a depopulation of 667,184 domestic birds. We incorporate half-saturated incidence and optimal control in our mathematical models in order to investigate three intervention strategies against H5N6: isolation with treatment, vaccination, and modified culling. We determine the direction of the bifurcation when R0=1 and show that all the models exhibit forward bifurcation. We apply the theory of optimal control and perform numerical simulations to compare the consequences and implementation cost of utilizing different intervention strategies in the poultry population. Despite the challenges of applying each control strategy, we show that culling both infected and susceptible birds is an effective control strategy in limiting an outbreak, with a consequence of losing a large number of birds; the isolation-treatment strategy has the potential to prevent an outbreak, but it highly depends on rapid isolation and successful treatment used; while vaccination alone is not enough to control the outbreak."

      abstract: "Voice guidance for car navigation typically considers drivers as docile actors. Recent works highlight limitations to this assumption which make drivers rely less on given directions. To explore how drivers can make better navigation decisions, we conducted a pilot Wizard-of-Oz study that gives turn suggestions in conversations between two voice agents. We asked 30 participants to drive in a simulation environment using voice guidance that gives three types of suggestions: familiar, optimal, and new routes. We examined their route choices, perceived workload and utterances while driving. We found that while most drivers followed directions appropriate for the given scenarios, they were more likely to make inappropriate choices after hearing alternatives in conversations. On the other hand, two-party conversations allowed drivers to better reflect on their choices after trips. We conclude by discussing preliminary design implications for car navigation voice guidance specifically and recommender systems in general."

      abstract: "Visualizers are usually added into music players to augment the listening experiences of hearing users. However, for the case of most members of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, they have partial deafness which may give them a “limited” listening experience as compared to their counterparts. In this paper, we present ViTune, a visualizer tool that enhances the musical experiences of the DHH through the use of an on-screen visualizer generating effects alongside music. We observed how members of the DHH community typically experienced music through an initial user study. We then iterated on developing a visualizer prototype where we did multiple usability tests involving at least 15 participants from the DHH community. We observed how they experienced music with the help of our prototype and noticed that certain music features and elements augmented these experiences. Visualization attributes, their matching qualitative descriptions and equivalent subjective attributes were identified with the help of music experts. Also, affects hypothesized to be induced and dissuaded were identified in improving these listening experiences."

However, we are still far from achieving universal citizen participation because data literacy and experience are necessary to extract insights from data. There is also no guarantee if available data can address people's information needs. We explored the potential of open government data portals in addressing the information needs of citizens through an online survey and found that these can only be partially answered by the available data. To understand their information seeking behavior, we conducted usability tests of open data portals with 21 citizens, and used semi-structured interviews to identify gaps in the portals' design. We found that citizens would benefit from: localized and advanced search engines; and visualized, contextualized, and processed content for better sensemaking. We conclude with design guidelines for open data portals catered to citizens."

      abstract: "DevOps is usually an industry approach that is practiced by seasoned and experienced programmers and developers. In most university settings especially in the Philippine context, DevOps is not usually part of the curriculum and in some cases are only introduced to learner programmers as an elective or as bonus material. We refer to these students in computing degree programs starting out in learning programming, as novice programmers. Upon graduation, these developers transition into industry roles where they are expected to be familiar with DevOps practices [18]. In most cases, they are not prepared, and fortunately, a great number of them are given training before fully transitioning into their hired roles. In this paper, we attempt to discover and design an intervention mechanism that can assist and prepare novice programmers to easily learn DevOps at an early stage. We gathered data and insights from novice programmers and inquired into their pains and struggles in learning and practicing DevOps. To help them in this process, we propose Grit, a prototype tool to support novice programmers in integrating DevOps. Initial insights provided affordances and design elements for a version control prototype with targetted intervention features.

      abstract: "In a university setting, academic timetabling has been an open opportunity for developers and system designers. It is usually focused on generating schedules, managing conflicts, accommodating constraints and even allocating respective logistical needs. There are several off-the-shelf and customized systems that have been developed to accommodate the varying needs of different universities and organizations. The usage and the underlying human factors when using these systems is another consideration that we can tackle with these enrollment systems. In this paper, we attempt to discover, design, implement an academic course scheduling system that considers user collaboration with other humans and with the computer itself. We iterated on developing a prototype for course scheduling, assigning of faculty and other pre-enrollment tasks. We observed stakeholders such as Department Chair, Academic Officers and other key personnel and inquired into their pains and struggles in academic course loading systems. To help them in this process, we present ASSYSTX: An online platform that supports collaboration between key personnel involved in enrollment systems. We also identified key collaboration points towards providing affordances that cater to the needs of these personnel."

      alt: Adversarial examples
      abstract: "Deep neural networks have gained popularity due to its exceptional performance on several challenging tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and image generation. Unfortunately, these networks are highly vulnerable to carefully crafted human imperceptible perturbations based on socalled adversarial examples. Adversarial examples have been used to mislead deep neural networks into predicting an incorrect output (i.e. category, label or class), sometimes with high confidence. Most approaches in constructing adversarial inputs require access to the gradients of the network, which is applicable only to gradient-based techniques. Others require only some access to the output function making these methods model-agnostic. In this work, we propose a mechanism that considers the neural network as a black-box by assuming that the network output is observed based only on the examined inputs. We focus our experiments on a model-agnostic adversarial example generation. Specifically, without exploiting the network gradients, we show that by aggregating neighboring images of an input image represented within a low dimensional input space and combine this with a perturbation technique referred to as “uniform pixels”, both convolutional neural network and vanilla neural network are vulnerable to incorrect predictions. As such, the proposed method can serve as a basis for designing more robust neural network models."

      alt: Toy network model of ignorant, exposed to, and spreader nodes.
      abstract: "Social networking sites have become instrumental in spreading information online, which unfortunately includes rumors and misinformation. Past studies have investigated the spread of rumors without considering that truth may spread simultaneously. This study considers both the spread of truth and rumor and investigates the result of their coexistence in a population. We formulated the spreader-spreader interaction model and the exposed-spreader interaction model based on the epidemiological SEIR model. In the spreader-spreader interaction model, the spreaders try to influence the opposing spreaders whereas, in the exposed-spreader interaction model, the spreaders try to influence the exposed individuals from the opposing side. In our study, we calculated the reproduction numbers for truth and rumor, determined the stability of the model at the equilibrium points, and determined an approach for spreading truth while halting rumors. In the spreader-spreader model, we have shown that increasing the removal rate of Spreaders of Rumor decreases the prevalence of rumor in the population. Whereas in the exposed-spreader model, we showed that increasing the conversion rate of Exposed to Rumor to Exposed to Truth significantly increases the amount of Exposed to Truth in the population, thereby making it an effective mechanism for promoting the spread of truth. In conclusion, it is harder to control the information epidemic in the exposed-spreader model but, compared to the spreader-spreader model, information spreads faster according to the exposed-spreader model. For certain information to be endemic to a population, our study proposes that spreaders take advantage during the first few days of the information diffusion process."

      alt: Traced deviations of drivers
      abstract: "Navigation applications are becoming ubiquitous in our daily navigation experiences. With the intention to circumnavigate congested roads, their route guidance always follows the basic assumption that drivers always want the fastest route. However, it is unclear how their recommendations are followed and what factors affect their adoption. We present the results of a semi-structured qualitative study with 17 drivers, mostly from the Philippines and Japan. We recorded their daily commutes and occasional trips, and inquired into their navigation practices, route choices and on-the-fly decision-making. We found that while drivers choose a recommended route in urgent situations, many still preferred to follow familiar routes. Drivers deviated because of a recommendation's use of unfamiliar roads, lack of local context, perceived driving unsuitability, and inconsistencies with realized navigation experiences. Our findings and implications emphasize their personalization needs, and how the right amount of algorithmic sophistication can encourage behavioral adaptation."

Observation and user research led to having a deeper understanding of the various needs, gains and pain points musicians encounter when composing. Musicians and composers who participated in the study, came from varying levels of expertise from beginner (those with less than 7 years) and veteran (those with beyond 10 years experience). An iterative process of design and development was continuously employed which led to improving the interaction design within the prototype. The processes described in this study show how insights were uncovered from a comprehensive set of usability tests and inspections done. These insights led to the development of a more usable and acceptable musical composition tool as seen from the results in the user tests. It can be observed that varying levels of expertise in music composition leads to different expectations and needs with regards to a music composition prototype. Results of the user tests show that Flow achieved a level of satisfaction and usability at par with the industry-standard tools."

However, these applications require a basic foundation in machine learning making them appear difficult to configure. We introduce the use of the Sandbox approach with the goal of designing alternative programming interfaces and interactions for machine learning tasks. A set of guidelines have been drafted supported with initial user tests to validate the proposed design framework. Ten (10) undergraduate and graduate students with novice experience in machine learning participated in structured interviews to formulate programming patterns and styles that were used to draft the guidelines based on the literary review. These insights were analyzed using UX Research techniques to form a general problem statement. Initial analysis of the user insights suggested that a visual sandbox approach similar to Scratch helps reduce the steepness of the learning curve. The preliminary design guidelines we drafted focused on the three design factors namely System Intent, Interaction, and Algorithm Visualization. From these guidelines we produced an initial version of the prototype that will be subject to further testing and validation."

In designing this interface, we performed field studies and on site surveying along with initial user tests to validate our ideas. Research through design was added into the methodology to consider multiple point of views considering varying sources of perspective. Specifically, we catered the design of an initial interface in helping multiple users understand several views from multiples cameras, angles and position. The participants chosen for this study are students who have at least the basic technological ability of using a smartphone and taking a video with it. We intend to extend this study by validating the 360-view and designing an algorithm towards stitching one final view crowd-sourced from multiple cameras and streamers."

In this preliminary study, we explore the design of an interaction that aims to balance the work of composers with the help of a mobile application. The process of musical composition is not easy for composers. Certain tasks such as figuring out succeeding notes often requires trial-and-error, as well as knowledge of certain theories. Existing technology has employed musical metacreation to assist in this process. This endows machines with the artificial creative capacity to perform musical tasks. In review, the existing technology has not been generally-used in all stages of the musical composition process. By combining several interaction technologies, composers can benefit by being able to do their tasks with significantly less cognitive load and time."

Majority of these studies never considered user experience as part of their approach. With that, we propose a new framework that eases usability by employing two-arm gestural electromyography instead of typical vision-based systems see Fig. 5. Interactions can be considered seamless and natural with this way. In this preliminary study, we conducted focus group discussions and usability tests with signers. Based on the results of the usability tests, 90% of respondents found the armband comfortable. The respondents also stated that the armband was not intrusive when they tried to perform their sign gestures. At the same time, they found it aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, we produced an initial prototype from this experiment setup and tested them on several conversational scenarios. By using this approach, we enable an agile framework that caters the needs of the signer-user."

However, their informal and demand-driven operation, like making arbitrary stops to pick up and drop off passengers, has been inefficient and poses challenges to efforts in integrating such services to more organized train and bus networks. In this study, we devised a methodology to design and optimize a road-based para-transit network using a genetic algorithm to optimize efficiency, robustness, and invulnerability. We first generated stops following certain geospatial distributions and connected them to build networks of routes. From them, we selected an initial population to be optimized and applied the genetic algorithm. Overall, our modified genetic algorithm with 20 evolutions optimized the 20% worst performing networks by 84% on average. For one network, we were able to significantly increase its fitness score by 223%. The highest fitness score the algorithm was able to produce through optimization was 0.532 from a score of 0.303."

      abstract: "Plant phenotyping is the process of completely assessing the basic and complex characteristics of the plant, which includes height and tiller count. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) researchers does plant phenotyping to observe changes in the physical characteristics of the C4 rice crops after modifying its genetic makeup to increase yields without using too much water, land and fertilizer resources. As this advances, the traditional way of observing phenotypic data is still trailing behind. Automated plant phenotyping offers an effective substitute because it allows a regulated image analysis that can be reproduced due to the automation. This is to address the lack in accuracy, reproducibility and traceability in manual phenotyping. With this, an image processing system that automates the measuring of height and the counting of tillers of a rice crop, specifically the C4 rice, was developed. The system applies HSV and Thresholding for preprocessing, Canny Edge Detection (tiller) and Zhang-Suen Thinning Algorithm (height) for the plant structure and tracing and conversion for measuring the height. Tiller counting is done by counting the cluster of pixels in a given region of interest. Four experiments were conducted using different setups and different combinations of algorithms. The fourth experiment was able to get an average percentage error of 76.14% for the tiller count and 238.11% for the height measurement. Presence of shadows and hanging leaves heavily affected the results of this experiment."

      abstract: "Plant phenotyping is a vital process that helps farmers and researchers assess the growth, health, and development of a plant. In the Philippines, phenotyping is done manually, with each plant specimen measured and assessed one by one. However, this process is laborious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Automated phenotyping systems have attempted to address this problem through the use of cameras and image processing, but these systems are proprietary and designed for plants and crops which are not commonly found in the Philippines. In order to alleviate this problem, research was conducted to develop an automated, high-throughput phenotyping system that automates the identification of plant greenness and plant biomass of rice. The system was developed in order to provide an efficient way of phenotyping rice by automating the process. It implements various image processing techniques and was tested in a screen house setup containing numerous rice variants. The system's design was finalized in consultation with and tested by rice researchers. The respondents were pleased with the system's usability and remarked that it would be beneficial to their current process if used. To evaluate the system's accuracy, the generated greenness and biomass values were compared with the values obtained through the manual process. The greenness module registered a 21.9792% mean percent error in comparison to using the Leaf Color Chart. On the other hand, the biomass module yielded 206.0700% mean percent error using compressed girth measurements."

      alt: EEG signals while watching a draft commercial
      abstract: "TV Commercials are often considered to be noise that viewers see in between their favorite shows. These have been used for mostly commercial and advertising purposes. Such practice has been an established one for decades. Most advertising researchers have always relied on traditional means and techniques in measuring viewer experiences and understanding conversion rates from these TV Commercials. In this work-in-progress, we present our preliminary findings from an exploratory study on understanding consumer behaviors and emotions especially when watching TV Commercials. Target consumers for a specific commercial product underwent one-on-one semi-structured interviews and from viewing sessions where their EEG data were collected using the 5-channel EMOTIV Insight headset. To triangulate the emotion modeling phase, external observers referred to as coders annotated their emotions with the aid of emotion recognition via facial recognition. Initial Analysis of the interviews along with the early version of the model revealed several interesting points on visual and audio elements that triggered viewer valence. The collection of EEG data was also able to uncover a few insights that aided in the design of a better viewing experience for the target consumers. We intend to expand the findings in the future work to build a model from a bigger data and user base along with a wider array of emotions to choose from. Also, we intend to employ more advanced experiment designs to determine if we can directly correlate viewer experiences into actual product and commercial conversion."

      abstract: "In this work-in-progress, we propose the design of an interaction that allows a guitar player to air guitar with the use of forearm Electromyogram (EMG). We integrate results from our previous study where we have used the same medium in training a classifier to recognize standard guitar chords. In this paper, we aim to train a classifier this time to recognize the different types of strums when playing the guitar. We collected data from ten (10) participants using the Myo armband doing strum repetitions for at least fifty (50) times. The strumming EMG data was then pre-processed and fed into a machine learning task to build a model. A k-Nearest Neighbor (k=11) classifier was trained and yielded an accuracy of at least 46% accuracy with a kappa statistic of 0.3712. Model results de- scribe that data size needs to be improved while considering equally the same set of features. Additionally, user insights and feedback on the armband usage as an alternative creative medium was gathered from our target respondents. Different views and insights are stated which opened opportunities for the improvement of the actual air guitar concept as a creativity tool."

      abstract: "Pest control strategies for crop diseases highly depend on visual inspection to assess the severity of the infection, which usually lead to inconsistencies: either over or under assessment. These inconsistencies could be attributed to the limitations of humans to perceive small differences. A more precise disease assessment is needed for better pest management decision, which will result to a more efficient utilization and allocation of resources for farm inputs. This translates to a better income for cacao farmers. This paper introduces a mobile application named AuToDiDAC or Automated Tool for Disease Detection and Assessment for Cacao Black Pod Rot (BPR). AuToDiDAC automatically detects, separates, and assesses the infection level of BPR in cacao through image processing and machine learning techniques. It gives the farmers the capacity to objectively monitor and report the infection level of the BPR compared to the common visual rating for plant disease level of infection. Pixel-level accuracy test of the tool showed an average of 84% accuracy on an independent test set of ten cacao pod images."

      abstract: "Overcrowding in mass rapid transit stations is a chronic issue affecting daily commute in Metro Manila, Philippines. As a high-capacity public transportation, the Metro Rail Transit has been operating at a level above its intended capacity of 350,000 passengers daily. Despite numerous efforts in implementing an effective crowd control scheme, it still falls short in containing the formation of crowds and long lines, thus affecting the amount of time before they can proceed to the platforms. A crowd dynamics model of commuters in one of the high-volume terminal stations, the Taft Ave station, was developed to help discover emergent behavior in crowd formation and assess infrastructure preparedness. The agent-based model uses static floor fields derived from the MRT3 live feed, and implements a number of social force models to optimize the path-finding of the commuter agents. Internal face validation, historical validation and parameter variability-sensitivity analysis were employed to validate the crowd dynamics model and assess different operational scenarios. It was determined that during peak hours, when the expected crowd inflow may reach up to 7,500 commuters, at least 11 ticket booths and 6 turnstiles should be open to have low turnaround times of commuters. For non-peak hours, at least 10 ticket booths and 5 turnstiles are needed to handle a crowd inflow reaching up to 5,000 commuters. In the current set-up, the usual number of ticket booths open in the MRT Taft Station is 11, and there are usually 6 turnstiles open. It was observed that as the crowd inside the station increases to 200-250 commuters, there is a significant increase in the increase rate of the turnaround times of the commuters, which signifies the point at which the service provided starts to degrade and when officials should start to intervene."

      abstract: "Despite being designed to accommodate only 300,000 passengers, Manila's Metro Rail Transit or MRT3 is currently serving more than 500,000 passengers daily. is over-utilization has resulted into worn down coaches and facilities, and most importantly, passenger delays. In this paper, we present an agent-based model for a Philippine mass rapid transit, particularly MRT3. The agent-based model uses passenger, train, and station agents, and allows the user to run different operational scenarios. Multiple scenarios were simulated, each having different parameters to differentiate their effects to the passenger congestion dynamics of MRT3. It was observed that passenger waiting time is at its minimum when the train speed and number of trains deployed is at their maximum values, 80kph and 20 trains, respectively. However, maintaining their default speed of 50kph and decreasing headway between trains to 1 minute will lead to a drastic increase in passenger waiting and journey times, negatively affecting passenger congestion at the platforms."

      abstract: "We explore the use of forearm electromyography (EMG) as a gestural input interface, or the captured biofeedback signals found in the muscles, towards modeling how beginner and seasoned guitar users plot chords in the fretboard. We intend to contribute to a paradigm of studies that propose a new set of interactions with an existing device, integrating machine learning techniques. Data was collected from ten(10) participants using the Myo™muscle armband. Data on the forearm EMG signals when fingers fret the chords A to F were recorded, preprocessed and transformed into a balanced and normalized dataset that was later on fed into a machine learning task in order to build a model. The model performs with an accuracy of at least 79% with 0.8 kappa statistic following a Bayesian classifier. Such model is expected to be used to train the computer and early learners of the guitar possibly with the goal of creating a synthesizer without any more requiring a MIDI interface or an actual guitar. This can be pushed further towards building an air guitar model."

      abstract: "A visualization and simulation tool for community-based datasets, from Angelo King Institute (AKI) of De La Salle University, called Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) is designed. Currently, there is no local visualization and simulation tool for CBMS data, which were gathered from individual households from various barangays in the country. The data in the CBMS dataset is mainly categorized into eight key indicators considered to be the basic needs of a local government unit and these are health, nutrition, housing, water and sanitation, education, income, employment, and peace and order. This research is useful not only for government officials, and local communities in creating or formulating policies, but also for economists. This tool is developed to give policymakers and program implementors necessary information to study the effect of macroeconomic reforms and different kinds of policy shocks. The application is designed to be web-based. It allows users to upload and extract data from the CBMS dataset through the data management module, to visualize the data with the use of maps (over Google Maps) and charts to provide a more accessible summary of the conditions inside a community, and simulate new indicators by providing simple formulas and view the results of effects adjusting the indicator reference values. Through the results based on economic computations performed on the data, this can help the government units in deciding what policies to implement in a certain community. Several prototypes were presented to CBMS AKI and various local government units in order to consider their needs and preferences. The final application user-interface and features were deemed very acceptable to the intended users."

#       abstract: "During winter, scheduled bus services can experience delays in locations where extreme and persistent snowfall affect road conditions. Commuters rushing to school or work often choose more flexible modes like taxis. However, taxi fares are more expensive for a single passenger, most especially students. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a carpool application for taxi services in Hakodate, Japan. Considering the high level of shyness among Japanese university students, the application intends to facilitate serendipitous discovery and group formation among Japanese students expressing intent to take taxi services."
