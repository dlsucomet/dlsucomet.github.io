      alt: Traced deviations of drivers
      abstract: "Navigation applications are becoming ubiquitous in our daily navigation experiences. With the intention to circumnavigate congested roads, their route guidance always follows the basic assumption that drivers always want the fastest route. However, it is unclear how their recommendations are followed and what factors affect their adoption. We present the results of a semi-structured qualitative study with 17 drivers, mostly from the Philippines and Japan. We recorded their daily commutes and occasional trips, and inquired into their navigation practices, route choices and on-the-fly decision-making. We found that while drivers choose a recommended route in urgent situations, many still preferred to follow familiar routes. Drivers deviated because of a recommendation's use of unfamiliar roads, lack of local context, perceived driving unsuitability, and inconsistencies with realized navigation experiences. Our findings and implications emphasize their personalization needs, and how the right amount of algorithmic sophistication can encourage behavioral adaptation."

      alt: Generated stops of Gridlock
      abstract: "In the developing world, majority of people usually take para-transit services for their everyday commutes. However, their informal and demand-driven operation, like making arbitrary stops to pick up and drop off passengers, has been inefficient and poses challenges to efforts in integrating such services to more organized train and bus networks. In this study, we devised a methodology to design and optimize a road-based para-transit network using a genetic algorithm to optimize efficiency, robustness, and invulnerability. We first generated stops following certain geospatial distributions and connected them to build networks of routes. From them, we selected an initial population to be optimized and applied the genetic algorithm. Overall, our modified genetic algorithm with 20 evolutions optimized the 20% worst performing networks by 84% on average. For one network, we were able to significantly increase its fitness score by 223%. The highest fitness score the algorithm was able to produce through optimization was 0.532 from a score of 0.303."

      alt: Annotated video screen capture of a station's concourse area
      abstract: "Overcrowding in mass rapid transit stations is a chronic issue affecting daily commute in Metro Manila, Philippines. As a high-capacity public transportation, the Metro Rail Transit has been operating at a level above its intended capacity of 350,000 passengers daily. Despite numerous efforts in implementing an effective crowd control scheme, it still falls short in containing the formation of crowds and long lines, thus affecting the amount of time before they can proceed to the platforms. A crowd dynamics model of commuters in one of the high-volume terminal stations, the Taft Ave station, was developed to help discover emergent behavior in crowd formation and assess infrastructure preparedness. The agent-based model uses static floor fields derived from the MRT3 live feed, and implements a number of social force models to optimize the path-finding of the commuter agents. Internal face validation, historical validation and parameter variability-sensitivity analysis were employed to validate the crowd dynamics model and assess different operational scenarios. It was determined that during peak hours, when the expected crowd inflow may reach up to 7,500 commuters, at least 11 ticket booths and 6 turnstiles should be open to have low turnaround times of commuters. For non-peak hours, at least 10 ticket booths and 5 turnstiles are needed to handle a crowd inflow reaching up to 5,000 commuters. In the current set-up, the usual number of ticket booths open in the MRT Taft Station is 11, and there are usually 6 turnstiles open. It was observed that as the crowd inside the station increases to 200-250 commuters, there is a significant increase in the increase rate of the turnaround times of the commuters, which signifies the point at which the service provided starts to degrade and when officials should start to intervene."

      alt: Snippet of the agent-based model for MRT3
      abstract: "Despite being designed to accommodate only 300,000 passengers, Manila's Metro Rail Transit or MRT3 is currently serving more than 500,000 passengers daily. is over-utilization has resulted into worn down coaches and facilities, and most importantly, passenger delays. In this paper, we present an agent-based model for a Philippine mass rapid transit, particularly MRT3. The agent-based model uses passenger, train, and station agents, and allows the user to run different operational scenarios. Multiple scenarios were simulated, each having different parameters to differentiate their effects to the passenger congestion dynamics of MRT3. It was observed that passenger waiting time is at its minimum when the train speed and number of trains deployed is at their maximum values, 80kph and 20 trains, respectively. However, maintaining their default speed of 50kph and decreasing headway between trains to 1 minute will lead to a drastic increase in passenger waiting and journey times, negatively affecting passenger congestion at the platforms."

      abstract: "A visualization and simulation tool for community-based datasets, from Angelo King Institute (AKI) of De La Salle University, called Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) is designed. Currently, there is no local visualization and simulation tool for CBMS data, which were gathered from individual households from various barangays in the country. The data in the CBMS dataset is mainly categorized into eight key indicators considered to be the basic needs of a local government unit and these are health, nutrition, housing, water and sanitation, education, income, employment, and peace and order. This research is useful not only for government officials, and local communities in creating or formulating policies, but also for economists. This tool is developed to give policymakers and program implementors necessary information to study the effect of macroeconomic reforms and different kinds of policy shocks. The application is designed to be web-based. It allows users to upload and extract data from the CBMS dataset through the data management module, to visualize the data with the use of maps (over Google Maps) and charts to provide a more accessible summary of the conditions inside a community, and simulate new indicators by providing simple formulas and view the results of effects adjusting the indicator reference values. Through the results based on economic computations performed on the data, this can help the government units in deciding what policies to implement in a certain community. Several prototypes were presented to CBMS AKI and various local government units in order to consider their needs and preferences. The final application user-interface and features were deemed very acceptable to the intended users."

      abstract: "In the Philippines, public participation in the creation of Senate and the House bills is very minimal. This could be the case because of the lack of accessibility of an ordinary citizen to take part in the lawmaking process and the complexity of the terms and grammar rules being used in legal proceedings called legalese. eParticipation is seen to be a solution to increase public participation but it only solves the process' accessibility and not the complexity of the bills. Simplification solves this problem by transforming technical jargons and complicated phrases into words or phrases that are easier to understand. Also, existing simplification systems do not cover Philippine Senate and House bills as part of their domain. This research focuses on developing a text simplification system using lexical and syntactic simplification method for Philippine Senate and House bills called Simpatico. It aims to simplify legalese to plain English, which a majority of the Philippine population can understand. The system is based on a mix of previous simplification systems and makes use of different tools in order to accomplish certain tasks for simplification. It is composed of 3 major components: the preprocessing module, lexical simplification module, and the syntactic simplification module."

      abstract: "Plant phenotyping is the process of completely assessing the basic and complex characteristics of the plant, which includes its height and tiller count. Automated plant phenotyping offers an effective substitute to manual visual assessments because it allows a regulated image analysis that can be reproduced and enables a high throughput because of the automation. This is to address the lack in accuracy, reproducibility and traceability in manual phenotyping. With this, the researchers developed an image processing system that automates the measuring of height and the counting of tillers of a rice crop, more specifically the C4 rice. The system is done by applying HSV and Thresholding for preprocessing, Canny Edge Detection (tiller) and Zhang-Suen Thinning Algorithm (height) for the plant structure and the Euclidean Distance for measuring the height. Tiller counting is done by counting the cluster of pixels in a given region of interest. The initial outputs were compared to the values manually measured by IRRI researchers from 50 plant images. There was a percentage error of 17.25% for height and 34.02% for tiller count. Errors may have been caused by plant not being able to fit the image frame and in result cut some parts of the plant. Another would be the effect of yellow leaves being removed during the preprocessing which produces an incomplete plant structure image. There are also leaves that are long that tend to bend and these leaves are then detected as the base instead of the real base."

      abstract: "Plant phenotyping is a vital process that helps farmers and researchers assess the growth, health, and development of a plant. In the Philippines, phenotyping is done manually, with each plant specimen measured and assessed individually, but this process is laborious, time-consuming, and prone to human-error. Automated phenotyping systems have attempted to address this problem through the use of cameras and image processing, but these systems are proprietary and designed for other plants. In order to alleviate this problem, the research aims to develop a high throughput rice phenotyping system that automates the identification of plant greenness and plant biomass of C4 Rice. This research group is currently developing a system that provides an efficient way of phenotyping C4 rice by automating the process. The system is being created and tested with consultation and feedback with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). It is based on various image processing techniques, existing tools and screen house setup used by IRRI. The system is now able to output Leaf Color Chart values for greenness and cubic centimeters for biomass approximation. The plant images are captured based on a specified schedule then these will be processed by the system. A web application is used to view the collected phenotypic data, and change system settings. Results show that the biomass generated by the system is moderately correlated (0.674) to the manually computed biomass while the greenness values are still undergoing verification."

      abstract: "Automatic story generation systems require a collection of commonsense knowledge to generate stories that contain logical and coherent sequences of events appropriate for their intended audience. But manually building and populating a semantic ontology that contains relevant assertions is a tedious task. Crowdsourcing can be used as an approach to quickly amass a large collection of commonsense concepts but requires validation of the quality of the knowledge that has been contributed by the public. Another approach is through relation extraction. This paper discusses the use of GATE and custom extraction rules to automatically extract binary conceptual relations from children's stories. Evaluation results show that the extractor achieved a very low overall accuracy of only 36% based on precision, recall and F-measure. The use of incomplete and generalized extraction patterns, insufficient text indicators, accuracy of existing tools, and inability to infer and detect implied relations were the major causes of the low accuracy scores."

Through the results based on economic computations performed on the data, this can help the government units in deciding what policies to implement in a certain community. By implementing agile development methodology, initial design and prototype of the application has been done. The prototype allows users to select fields and ranges of values to visualize and simulate. Careful design and presentation of information is necessary so that it is easy to comprehend. A menu of simulation parameters will be built into the software. Theseparameters will be curated based on the most recent and relevant to the data available, and may be updated."

      abstract: "A lexicon is an essential resource in the Natural Language Processing research. It provides the link between the terms of a language and the semantic and syntactic properties they are associated with. For the Filipino language, only bilingual and multilingual lexicons are available electronically. Generally, the only information they contain are the translations of a term from one language to another. They do not have information on thematic roles, which are the relations of verbs and their arguments. These relations are useful because they could allow systems to check whether the required arguments are present in the sentence. To augment manual entries of the thematic roles into the lexicon, automatic learning of thematic roles of verb arguments is explored. This paper presents the resources needed, the processes, and the results."

      abstract: "Plant phenotyping is the process of completely assessing the basic and complex characteristics of the plant, which includes height and tiller count. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) researchers does plant phenotyping to observe changes in the physical characteristics of the C4 rice crops after modifying its genetic makeup to increase yields without using too much water, land and fertilizer resources. As this advances, the traditional way of observing phenotypic data is still trailing behind. Automated plant phenotyping offers an effective substitute because it allows a regulated image analysis that can be reproduced due to the automation. This is to address the lack in accuracy, reproducibility and traceability in manual phenotyping. With this, an image processing system that automates the measuring of height and the counting of tillers of a rice crop, specifically the C4 rice, was developed. The system applies HSV and Thresholding for preprocessing, Canny Edge Detection (tiller) and Zhang-Suen Thinning Algorithm (height) for the plant structure and tracing and conversion for measuring the height. Tiller counting is done by counting the cluster of pixels in a given region of interest. Four experiments were conducted using different setups and different combinations of algorithms. The fourth experiment was able to get an average percentage error of 76.14% for the tiller count and 238.11% for the height measurement. Presence of shadows and hanging leaves heavily affected the results of this experiment."

Automated phenotyping systems have attempted to address this problem through the use of cameras and image processing, but these systems are proprietary and designed for plants and crops which are not commonly found in the Philippines. In order to alleviate this problem, research was conducted to develop an automated, high-throughput phenotyping system that automates the identification of plant greenness and plant biomass of rice. The system was developed in order to provide an efficient way of phenotyping rice by automating the process. It implements various image processing techniques and was tested in a screen house setup containing numerous rice variants. The system's design was finalized in consultation with and tested by rice researchers. The respondents were pleased with the system's usability and remarked that it would be beneficial to their current process if used. To evaluate the system's accuracy, the generated greenness and biomass values were compared with the values obtained through the manual process. The greenness module registered a 21.9792% mean percent error in comparison to using the Leaf Color Chart. On the other hand, the biomass module yielded 206.0700% mean percent error using compressed girth measurements."

      abstract: "During winter, scheduled bus services can experience delays in locations where extreme and persistent snowfall affect road conditions. Commuters rushing to school or work often choose more flexible modes like taxis. However, taxi fares are more expensive for a single passenger, most especially students. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a carpool application for taxi services in Hakodate, Japan. Considering the high level of shyness among Japanese university students, the application intends to facilitate serendipitous discovery and group formation among Japanese students expressing intent to take taxi services."

      abstract: "In today's time, more and more complicated programs are being released; from the traditional, centralized client server type to the distributed environmental one, they create further problems such as managing resources, accessing concurrency, incidence of communication infrastructure, deprivation of security and privacy. This is for the reason that not all resources that are being made may last for an extended time. Eventually, some of them may become idle and would no longer be in use therefore leasing distributed garbage collection to come in. There will be an implementation of distributed garbage collection but will frequently do not perform well in a disseminated manner and will only focus to a specific environment. Thus, a new algorithm was formulated by analyzing the best features of the current use of distributed garbage collection method. The features were then compiled into producing an improved system. After implementing and testing the generalized distributed garbage collection algorithm, results show that based on performance in terms of processing time, it runs in linear time as opposed to the exponential time of available algorithms."
