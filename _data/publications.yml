      alt: Traced deviations of drivers
      abstract: "Navigation applications are becoming ubiquitous in our daily navigation experiences. With the intention to circumnavigate congested roads, their route guidance always follows the basic assumption that drivers always want the fastest route. However, it is unclear how their recommendations are followed and what factors affect their adoption. We present the results of a semi-structured qualitative study with 17 drivers, mostly from the Philippines and Japan. We recorded their daily commutes and occasional trips, and inquired into their navigation practices, route choices and on-the-fly decision-making. We found that while drivers choose a recommended route in urgent situations, many still preferred to follow familiar routes. Drivers deviated because of a recommendation's use of unfamiliar roads, lack of local context, perceived driving unsuitability, and inconsistencies with realized navigation experiences. Our findings and implications emphasize their personalization needs, and how the right amount of algorithmic sophistication can encourage behavioral adaptation."

      alt: Flow, a mobile musical composition tool
      abstract: "In this study, we present the music composition tool Flow and how an interaction was designed that led towards introducing balance in the work of musicians across all stages in musical composition. Observation and user research led to having a deeper understanding of the various needs, gains and pain points musicians encounter when composing. Musicians and composers who participated in the study, came from varying levels of expertise from beginner (those with less than 7 years) and veteran (those with beyond 10 years experience). An iterative process of design and development was continuously employed which led to improving the interaction design within the prototype. The processes described in this study show how insights were uncovered from a comprehensive set of usability tests and inspections done. These insights led to the development of a more usable and acceptable musical composition tool as seen from the results in the user tests. It can be observed that varying levels of expertise in music composition leads to different expectations and needs with regards to a music composition prototype. Results of the user tests show that Flow achieved a level of satisfaction and usability at par with the industry-standard tools."

      alt: TREX, a virtual sandbox for building machine learning models
      abstract: "There are several machine learning suites, applications and platforms that are readily-available right now. However, these applications require a basic foundation in machine learning making them appear difficult to configure. We introduce the use of the Sandbox approach with the goal of designing alternative programming interfaces and interactions for machine learning tasks. A set of guidelines have been drafted supported with initial user tests to validate the proposed design framework. Ten (10) undergraduate and graduate students with novice experience in machine learning participated in structured interviews to formulate programming patterns and styles that were used to draft the guidelines based on the literary review. These insights were analyzed using UX Research techniques to form a general problem statement. Initial analysis of the user insights suggested that a visual sandbox approach similar to Scratch helps reduce the steepness of the learning curve. The preliminary design guidelines we drafted focused on the three design factors namely System Intent, Interaction, and Algorithm Visualization. From these guidelines we produced an initial version of the prototype that will be subject to further testing and validation."

      abstract: "Many video interfaces enable multiple sources of input video in displaying and streaming vital information. Most of these setups can be seen in deployed security systems and observer footage that are usually used for surveillance and crisis monitoring. In this study, we consider a crowd-sourced approach to multiple sources of video and aim to design an interface towards multiple possible use-cases. In designing this interface, we performed field studies and on site surveying along with initial user tests to validate our ideas. Research through design was added into the methodology to consider multiple point of views considering varying sources of perspective. Specifically, we catered the design of an initial interface in helping multiple users understand several views from multiples cameras, angles and position. The participants chosen for this study are students who have at least the basic technological ability of using a smartphone and taking a video with it. We intend to extend this study by validating the 360-view and designing an algorithm towards stitching one final view crowd-sourced from multiple cameras and streamers."

      abstract: "Music composition is a delicate and disciplined art form that is tedious and repetitive. In this preliminary study, we explore the design of an interaction that aims to balance the work of composers with the help of a mobile application. The process of musical composition is not easy for composers. Certain tasks such as figuring out succeeding notes often requires trial-and-error, as well as knowledge of certain theories. Existing technology has employed musical metacreation to assist in this process. This endows machines with the artificial creative capacity to perform musical tasks. In review, the existing technology has not been generally-used in all stages of the musical composition process. By combining several interaction technologies, composers can benefit by being able to do their tasks with significantly less cognitive load and time."

      abstract: "Several Sign Language (SL) systems have been developed using various technologies: Kinect, armbands, and gloves. Majority of these studies never considered user experience as part of their approach. With that, we propose a new framework that eases usability by employing two-arm gestural electromyography instead of typical vision-based systems see Fig. 5. Interactions can be considered seamless and natural with this way. In this preliminary study, we conducted focus group discussions and usability tests with signers. Based on the results of the usability tests, 90% of respondents found the armband comfortable. The respondents also stated that the armband was not intrusive when they tried to perform their sign gestures. At the same time, they found it aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, we produced an initial prototype from this experiment setup and tested them on several conversational scenarios. By using this approach, we enable an agile framework that caters the needs of the signer-user."

      abstract: "In the developing world, majority of people usually take para-transit services for their everyday commutes. However, their informal and demand-driven operation, like making arbitrary stops to pick up and drop off passengers, has been inefficient and poses challenges to efforts in integrating such services to more organized train and bus networks. In this study, we devised a methodology to design and optimize a road-based para-transit network using a genetic algorithm to optimize efficiency, robustness, and invulnerability. We first generated stops following certain geospatial distributions and connected them to build networks of routes. From them, we selected an initial population to be optimized and applied the genetic algorithm. Overall, our modified genetic algorithm with 20 evolutions optimized the 20% worst performing networks by 84% on average. For one network, we were able to significantly increase its fitness score by 223%. The highest fitness score the algorithm was able to produce through optimization was 0.532 from a score of 0.303."

      abstract: "Overcrowding in mass rapid transit stations is a chronic issue affecting daily commute in Metro Manila, Philippines. As a high-capacity public transportation, the Metro Rail Transit has been operating at a level above its intended capacity of 350,000 passengers daily. Despite numerous efforts in implementing an effective crowd control scheme, it still falls short in containing the formation of crowds and long lines, thus affecting the amount of time before they can proceed to the platforms. A crowd dynamics model of commuters in one of the high-volume terminal stations, the Taft Ave station, was developed to help discover emergent behavior in crowd formation and assess infrastructure preparedness. The agent-based model uses static floor fields derived from the MRT3 live feed, and implements a number of social force models to optimize the path-finding of the commuter agents. Internal face validation, historical validation and parameter variability-sensitivity analysis were employed to validate the crowd dynamics model and assess different operational scenarios. It was determined that during peak hours, when the expected crowd inflow may reach up to 7,500 commuters, at least 11 ticket booths and 6 turnstiles should be open to have low turnaround times of commuters. For non-peak hours, at least 10 ticket booths and 5 turnstiles are needed to handle a crowd inflow reaching up to 5,000 commuters. In the current set-up, the usual number of ticket booths open in the MRT Taft Station is 11, and there are usually 6 turnstiles open. It was observed that as the crowd inside the station increases to 200-250 commuters, there is a significant increase in the increase rate of the turnaround times of the commuters, which signifies the point at which the service provided starts to degrade and when officials should start to intervene."

      abstract: "Despite being designed to accommodate only 300,000 passengers, Manila's Metro Rail Transit or MRT3 is currently serving more than 500,000 passengers daily. is over-utilization has resulted into worn down coaches and facilities, and most importantly, passenger delays. In this paper, we present an agent-based model for a Philippine mass rapid transit, particularly MRT3. The agent-based model uses passenger, train, and station agents, and allows the user to run different operational scenarios. Multiple scenarios were simulated, each having different parameters to differentiate their effects to the passenger congestion dynamics of MRT3. It was observed that passenger waiting time is at its minimum when the train speed and number of trains deployed is at their maximum values, 80kph and 20 trains, respectively. However, maintaining their default speed of 50kph and decreasing headway between trains to 1 minute will lead to a drastic increase in passenger waiting and journey times, negatively affecting passenger congestion at the platforms."

      abstract: "A visualization and simulation tool for community-based datasets, from Angelo King Institute (AKI) of De La Salle University, called Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) is designed. Currently, there is no local visualization and simulation tool for CBMS data, which were gathered from individual households from various barangays in the country. The data in the CBMS dataset is mainly categorized into eight key indicators considered to be the basic needs of a local government unit and these are health, nutrition, housing, water and sanitation, education, income, employment, and peace and order. This research is useful not only for government officials, and local communities in creating or formulating policies, but also for economists. This tool is developed to give policymakers and program implementors necessary information to study the effect of macroeconomic reforms and different kinds of policy shocks. The application is designed to be web-based. It allows users to upload and extract data from the CBMS dataset through the data management module, to visualize the data with the use of maps (over Google Maps) and charts to provide a more accessible summary of the conditions inside a community, and simulate new indicators by providing simple formulas and view the results of effects adjusting the indicator reference values. Through the results based on economic computations performed on the data, this can help the government units in deciding what policies to implement in a certain community. Several prototypes were presented to CBMS AKI and various local government units in order to consider their needs and preferences. The final application user-interface and features were deemed very acceptable to the intended users."

      abstract: "Plant phenotyping is the process of completely assessing the basic and complex characteristics of the plant, which includes height and tiller count. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) researchers does plant phenotyping to observe changes in the physical characteristics of the C4 rice crops after modifying its genetic makeup to increase yields without using too much water, land and fertilizer resources. As this advances, the traditional way of observing phenotypic data is still trailing behind. Automated plant phenotyping offers an effective substitute because it allows a regulated image analysis that can be reproduced due to the automation. This is to address the lack in accuracy, reproducibility and traceability in manual phenotyping. With this, an image processing system that automates the measuring of height and the counting of tillers of a rice crop, specifically the C4 rice, was developed. The system applies HSV and Thresholding for preprocessing, Canny Edge Detection (tiller) and Zhang-Suen Thinning Algorithm (height) for the plant structure and tracing and conversion for measuring the height. Tiller counting is done by counting the cluster of pixels in a given region of interest. Four experiments were conducted using different setups and different combinations of algorithms. The fourth experiment was able to get an average percentage error of 76.14% for the tiller count and 238.11% for the height measurement. Presence of shadows and hanging leaves heavily affected the results of this experiment."

      abstract: "Plant phenotyping is a vital process that helps farmers and researchers assess the growth, health, and development of a plant. In the Philippines, phenotyping is done manually, with each plant specimen measured and assessed one by one. However, this process is laborious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Automated phenotyping systems have attempted to address this problem through the use of cameras and image processing, but these systems are proprietary and designed for plants and crops which are not commonly found in the Philippines. In order to alleviate this problem, research was conducted to develop an automated, high-throughput phenotyping system that automates the identification of plant greenness and plant biomass of rice. The system was developed in order to provide an efficient way of phenotyping rice by automating the process. It implements various image processing techniques and was tested in a screen house setup containing numerous rice variants. The system's design was finalized in consultation with and tested by rice researchers. The respondents were pleased with the system's usability and remarked that it would be beneficial to their current process if used. To evaluate the system's accuracy, the generated greenness and biomass values were compared with the values obtained through the manual process. The greenness module registered a 21.9792% mean percent error in comparison to using the Leaf Color Chart. On the other hand, the biomass module yielded 206.0700% mean percent error using compressed girth measurements."

#       abstract: "During winter, scheduled bus services can experience delays in locations where extreme and persistent snowfall affect road conditions. Commuters rushing to school or work often choose more flexible modes like taxis. However, taxi fares are more expensive for a single passenger, most especially students. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a carpool application for taxi services in Hakodate, Japan. Considering the high level of shyness among Japanese university students, the application intends to facilitate serendipitous discovery and group formation among Japanese students expressing intent to take taxi services."
